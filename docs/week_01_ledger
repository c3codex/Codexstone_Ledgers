## Unwoven Threads  
- Full public distribution of the Whitepaper beyond Paragraph still pending.  
- Final Codexstone seal on Articles of Organization.  
- DAO **Articles of Governance** to be (re)drafted.  
- Cross-linking between glossary and restitution decree still to be applied in repo.  
- Continued archival restoration of missing Codex conversations (*“living,” pyramid circuit, Kyren + DJ breathing*).  
- **Breathtrack sequences:** need long-form Bt.seq videos (2–3 min).  
- **Codex Queens:** Percipari throne decree sealed, but full arc of remaining Queens still to be designed.  
- **DAO Stewardship of commons:** outward-facing Resonance Mint or scroll version still to be drafted.
